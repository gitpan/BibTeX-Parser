BibTeX-Parser 0.2

This module parses BibTeX files in pure perl. It provides a relatively high 
level of abstraction, so you don't need to be concerned with the details of 
the file format.

This version is still alpha software. Error handling might not be as polished
as it should be. Also, later versions will probably "de-TeXifify" the return 
values, which is a good thing (convert characters to unicode etc).

However, the api will probably remain stable.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
